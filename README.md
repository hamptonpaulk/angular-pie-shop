# Angular Pie Shop

## NOTE ON STACKBLITZ:

Stackblitz is buggy with the current version of angular (16.2.7) and zone.js - This can cause errors when loading the main site and with images not loading - if you fork this repo it usually fixes the issues. _usually_

If you really want to get going, do this for your OS

1. install node 18 (this is important for angular compatibility)
2. download the [repo from github](https://github.com/hamptonpaulk/angular-pie-shop) (where this is forked from)
3. [download vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and install it.
4. open the downloaded folder/project in vscode
5. open a terminal in vscode (control + backtick) or under the terminal top menu
6. type 'npm install' and wait until complete
7. type 'npm start' to start the angualr application
8. point your browser at [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

Have fun.
